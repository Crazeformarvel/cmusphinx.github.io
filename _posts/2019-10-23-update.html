<p>Dear users, you've might been asking yourself why there were not so
many updates on CMUSphinx recently. Time goes really fast and many
things change in ASR. Deep learning, huge NLP models like BERT, Tacotron
and Wavenet/Waveglow/WaveRNN, Pytorch vs Tensorflow, huge datsets,
chatbots and so on and so forth. Many new toolkits appear and some
disappear - Eesen, Espresso, Kaldi, Wav2letter, NeMo. The whole area is
thriving.</p>

<p>CMUSphinx team has been actively participating in all those
activities, creating new models, applications, helping  newcomers and
showing the best way to implement speech recognition system. We are here
to suggest you the easiest way to start such an exciting world of speech
recognition. Lately we implemented a <a

Android</a>, providing much better accuracy for large vocabulary
decoding, which was hard to imagine before.<p>
