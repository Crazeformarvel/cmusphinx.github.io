title: Installing SciPy for Sphinxtrain
---

This page details the things you need to install on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS 
X in order to do Python development with SphinxTrain.

Note that Python is **not** currently **required** to use SphinxTrain, unless 
you wish to use [LDA and MLLT feature transforms](LDAMLLT).  However, 
prototyping and research is currently being done primarily using Python.

First, install Python.  For Windows and Mac OS X, the latest release can be 
found at http://www.python.org/download/.  On Linux, it should be installed 
with your distribution.

Next, install NumPy and SciPy.  For Windows, there are binary packages at 
http://scipy.org/Download.  On Mac OS X, you may be able to find it via 
[Fink](http://fink.sf.net) or [DarwinPorts](http://darwinports.com/).  On 
Linux, it should be available in most recent distributions.  On Ubuntu and 
Debian, for instance, you can just run:

	
	apt-get install python-scipy


If you don't have a binary package to install, then you can compile it from 
source following the instructions on http://scipy.org/Download.

You can also optionally install [iPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/) and 
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) for enhanced interactive use 
and MATLAB-like graphics.

Now, if you wish to install the SphinxTrain Python modules system-wide, go to 
the `python` directory inside your SphinxTrain installation and run:

	
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install
