title: CMUSphinx Tutorial For Developers
---

## Introduction

This tutorial is going to describe some applications of the CMUSphinx toolkit.
Such applications could include voice control of your desktop, various
automotive devices and intelligent houses. Other possible applications are
speech transcription, closed captioning, speech translation, voice
search and language learning. If you want to create one of them,
the CMUSphinx toolkit is your choice.

The tutorial is intended for developers who need to apply speech
technology in their applications, not for speech recognition researchers.
If you are a researcher, itâ€™s recommended to start with a textbook on speech
technologies. [Spoken Language Processing by Acero, Huang and
others](http://www.amazon.com/Spoken-Language-Processing-Algorithm-Development/d
p/0130226165 ) is a good choice for that.
