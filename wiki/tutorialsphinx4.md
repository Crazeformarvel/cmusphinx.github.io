  This tutorial uses the sphinx4 API from the [5 pre-alpha release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/5prealpha/).  
  The API described here is not supported in earlier versions.

## Overview

Sphinx4 is a pure Java speech recognition library. It provides a quick and easy
API to convert the speech recordings into text with the help of CMUSphinx
acoustic models. It can be used on servers and in desktop applications. Besides
speech recognition, Sphinx4 helps to identify speakers, to adapt models, to
align existing transcription to audio for timestamping and more.

Sphinx4 supports US English and many other languages.

## Using sphinx4 in your projects

As any library in Java all you need to do to use sphinx4 is to add the jars to
the dependencies of your project and then you can write code using the API.

The easiest way to use sphinx4 is to use modern build tools like [
Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.1.0/ ) or [
Gradle](http://gradle.org). Sphinx-4 is available as a maven package in the [
Sonatype OSS repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/ ).

In gradle you need the following lines in `build.gradle`:

```
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
}

dependencies {
    compile group: 'edu.cmu.sphinx', name: 'sphinx4-core', version:'5prealpha-SNAPSHOT'
    compile group: 'edu.cmu.sphinx', name: 'sphinx4-data', version:'5prealpha-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

To use sphinx4 in your maven project specify this repository in your `pom.xml`:

```
<project>
...
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
...
</project>
```

Then add `sphinx4-core` to the project dependencies:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.cmu.sphinx</groupId>
  <artifactId>sphinx4-core</artifactId>
  <version>5prealpha-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Add `sphinx4-data` to the dependencies as well if you want to use the default
US English acoustic and language models:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.cmu.sphinx</groupId>
  <artifactId>sphinx4-data</artifactId>
  <version>5prealpha-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Many IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans or Idea have support for Gradle
either through plugins or with built-in features. In that case you can just
include sphinx4 libraries into your project with the help of your IDE.
Please check the relevant part of your IDE documentation, for example the
[IDEA documentation on Gradle](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/gradle.html).

You can also use Sphinx4 in a non-maven project. In this case you need to
download the jars from the
[repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search) manually. You might also
need to download the dependencies (which we try to keep small) and
include  them in your project. You need the *sphinx4-core* jar and the
*sphinx4-data* jar if you are going to use US English acoustic model:

Here is an example for how to include the jars in Eclipse:

## Basic Usage

To quickly start with sphinx4, create a java project as described above, add
the required dependencies and type the following simple code:

```java
package com.example;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

import edu.cmu.sphinx.api.Configuration;
import edu.cmu.sphinx.api.SpeechResult;
import edu.cmu.sphinx.api.StreamSpeechRecognizer;

public class TranscriberDemo {       

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

        configuration.setAcousticModelPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/en-us");
        configuration.setDictionaryPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/cmudict-en-us.dict");
        configuration.setLanguageModelPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/en-us.lm.bin");

	StreamSpeechRecognizer recognizer = new StreamSpeechRecognizer(configuration);
	InputStream stream = new FileInputStream(new File("test.wav"));

        recognizer.startRecognition(stream);
	SpeechResult result;
        while ((result = recognizer.getResult()) != null) {
	    System.out.format("Hypothesis: %s\n", result.getHypothesis());
	}
	recognizer.stopRecognition();
    }
}
```

This simple code snippet transcribes the file `test.wav` â€“ just make sure it
exists in the project root.

There are several high-level recognition interfaces in sphinx4:

  *  LiveSpeechRecognizer
  *  StreamSpeechRecognizer
  *  SpeechAligner

For most of the speech recognition jobs high-level interfaces should be
sufficient. Basically, you will only have to setup four attributes:

  *  Acoustic model
  *  Dictionary
  *  Grammar/Language model
  *  Source of speech

The first three attributes are set up using a `Configuration` object which is
then passed to a recognizer. The way to connect to a speech source depends on
your concrete recognizer and usually is passed as a method parameter.

### Configuration

A `Configuration` is used to supply the required and optional attributes
to the recognizer.

```java
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

// Set path to acoustic model.
configuration.setAcousticModelPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/en-us");
// Set path to dictionary.
configuration.setDictionaryPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/cmudict-en-us.dict");
// Set language model.
configuration.setLanguageModelPath("resource:/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us/en-us.lm.bin");
```

### LiveSpeechRecognizer

The `LiveSpeechRecognizer` uses a microphone as the speech source.


```java
LiveSpeechRecognizer recognizer = new LiveSpeechRecognizer(configuration);
// Start recognition process pruning previously cached data.
recognizer.startRecognition(true);
SpeechResult result = recognizer.getResult();
// Pause recognition process. It can be resumed then with startRecognition(false).
recognizer.stopRecognition();
```

### StreamSpeechRecognizer

The `StreamSpeechRecognizer` uses an `InputStream` as the speech source. You can
pass the data from a file, a network socket or from an existing byte array.

```java
StreamSpeechRecognizer recognizer = new StreamSpeechRecognizer(configuration);
recognizer.startRecognition(new FileInputStream("speech.wav"));

SpeechResult result = recognizer.getResult();
recognizer.stopRecognition();
```

Please note that the audio for this decoding must have one of the following
formats:

```
RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz
```
or

```
RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 8000 Hz
```

The decoder does not support other formats. If the audio format does not match,
you will not get any results. This means, you need to convert your audio to a
proper format before decoding. E.g. if you want to decode audio in telephone
quality with a sample rate of 8000 Hz, you would need to call

```java
configuration.setSampleRate(8000);
```

You can retreive multiple results until the end of the file is reached:

```java
while ((result = recognizer.getResult()) != null) {
    System.out.println(result.getHypothesis());
}
```

### SpeechAligner

A `SpeechAligner` time-aligns text with audio speech.

```java
SpeechAligner aligner = new SpeechAligner(configuration);
recognizer.align(new URL("101-42.wav"), "one oh one four two");
```

### SpeechResult

A `SpeechResult` provides access to various parts of the recognition result,
such as the recognized utterance, a list of words with timestamps, the
recognition lattice, etc.:

```java
// Print utterance string without filler words.
System.out.println(result.getHypothesis());

// Get individual words and their times.
for (WordResult r : result.getWords()) {
    System.out.println(r);
}

// Save lattice in a graphviz format.
result.getLattice().dumpDot("lattice.dot", "lattice");
```

## Demos

A number of sample demos are included in the sphinx4 sources in order to give
you an understanding how to run sphinx4. You can run them from the
sphinx4-samples jar:

   * [Transcriber](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/blob/master/sphinx4-samples/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/transcriber/TranscriberDemo.java ) - demonstrates how to transcribe a file
   * [Dialog](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/blob/master/sphinx4-samples/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/dialog/DialogDemo.java ) - demonstrates how to lead a dialog with a user
   * [SpeakerID](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/blob/master/sphinx4-samples/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/speakerid/SpeakerIdentificationDemo.java) - speaker identification
   * [Aligner](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/blob/master/sphinx4-samples/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/demo/aligner/AlignerDemo.java ) - demonstration of audio to transcription timestamping

If you are going to start with a demo please do not modify the demo inside
the sphinx4 sources. Instead, copy the code into your project and modify it there.

## Building from source

If you want to develop sphinx4 itself you might want to build it from source.  
Sphinx4 uses the [Gradle](http://gradle.org) build system. In order to compile
and install everything, including the dependencies, simply type 'gradle  build'
in the root directory.

If you are going to use an IDE, make sure it supports Gradle projects. Then
simply import the sphinx4 source tree.

## Troubleshooting

You might experience the one or the other problem while using sphinx4. Please
check the [FAQ](/wiki/faq) first before asking any new questions on the forum.

In case you have issues with the accuracy, you need to provide the audio
recording you are trying to recognize along with all models you use.
Additionally, you need to describe in which way your results differ from your
expectations.
